# Hey 👋

Software engineer building AI tools and occasionally closing my own issues.

## What I'm Building

- **AI productivity tools** - Automating the stuff I don't want to do twice
- **FinOps tooling** - Watching API bills so you don't have to check your email at 3am
- **OSS contributions** - Finally contributing instead of just starring repos

## Stack

**Frontend:** TypeScript, Next.js, React  
**Backend:** Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL  
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, Transformers, OpenAI, Anthropic  
**Infra:** Docker, AWS, Vercel

## Currently Exploring

Multi-agent systems, RAG pipelines, fine-tuning, and figuring out why my context window is never big enough.
