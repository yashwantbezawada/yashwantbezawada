# Hey there! 👋

Software engineer building AI-powered tools and contributing to open source. Currently exploring the intersection of LLMs, developer tooling, and productivity apps.

## 🚀 What I'm building

Building with modern web stack (TypeScript/Next.js) and integrating cutting-edge AI models. Focus areas:
- **AI-powered productivity tools** - Making workflows smarter
- **Developer automation** - Because repetitive tasks are for robots
- **FinOps tooling** - Cloud cost optimization and analysis
- **OSS contribution frameworks** - Systematizing open source work

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
**Backend:** Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, Transformers, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral
**Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS, Vercel

## 🌟 Recent OSS Contributions
