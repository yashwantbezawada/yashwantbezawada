# Hey there! 👋

I'm a software engineer who builds things with AI and occasionally remembers to contribute back to the OSS projects I shamelessly depend on.

## 🤖 What I'm Actually Building

Not another ChatGPT wrapper, I promise. Well, not *just* wrappers:

- **AI productivity tools** - Because apparently we need AI to be productive now
- **Developer automation** - Teaching robots to do the boring stuff since 2025
- **FinOps tooling** - Someone has to watch those OpenAI API bills spiral
- **OSS contribution frameworks** - Systematically giving back to maintainers who deserve better

## 🛠️ The Stack

**Frontend:** TypeScript, Next.js, React (yes, I know Svelte exists)
**Backend:** Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL (the boring reliable stuff)
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, Transformers, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral (collecting API keys like Pokémon)
**Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS, Vercel (pray the serverless cold starts are merciful)

## 🎯 Recent OSS Contributions

Turns out you can actually contribute to the libraries you use instead of just starring them:

- **[Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)** - Fixed docs because reading is important ([#21827](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/21827) ✓ merged)
- **[PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)** - Type annotations and code cleanup ([#167241](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/167241), [#167256](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/167256))
- Working across AI SDK repos - Because one LLM provider is never enough

## 📊 Stats (that definitely matter)

## 💭 Current Obsessions

Following the AI hype cycle very responsibly:

- **Multi-agent systems** - Because one AI wasn't chaotic enough
- **RAG architectures** - Turns out models don't actually know everything
- **Context windows** - Remember when 8k tokens was impressive?
- **Fine-tuning** - For when prompts just aren't cutting it
- **AI-native workflows** - Whatever that means this week

## 🎮 Fun Facts

- I have more API keys than passwords (this is fine)
- My `package.json` is 90% AI dependencies
- I've starred 500+ repos I'll "definitely read later"
- Contributing to OSS is cheaper than therapy
