# Hey 👋

I'm a software engineer driven by curiosity, building developer tools and AI infrastructure. I spend a bit too much time on GitHub tackling a never-ending growing number of projects and ideas.

I love Linux (I use Arch, btw), open-source software, and Neovim. An LLM enthusiast who's been lucky enough to get hands dirty building AI-powered tools - from RAG pipelines to multi-agent systems, along with the developer tooling to make it all work. Helping around as much as I can.
