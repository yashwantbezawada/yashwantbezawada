# Hey 👋

Software engineer building AI-powered developer tools and infrastructure.

## What I Do

I build tools that make developers' lives easier - from AI productivity apps to FinOps solutions that keep cloud costs from becoming a horror story. Most of my work lives at the intersection of LLMs, developer experience, and infrastructure.

When I'm not shipping features, I contribute to open source projects like PyTorch and Keras.

## What I Work With

TypeScript, Python, React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, PyTorch, and whatever LLM API is trending this week.

## Currently Exploring

Multi-agent systems, RAG pipelines, fine-tuning workflows, and figuring out why my context window is never big enough.
